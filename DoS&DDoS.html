        <h1>Welcome to the DoS/DDoS page</h1>
        
        <p>I will give an explanation on what a DoS and DDoS attack is and what the difference is between the two types of attacks.</p>
      </section>

        <h2>What is a DoS attack?</h2>
        
        <p>Denial of Service (DoS) attack is, in its simplest form, a cyber attacker using the limitations of the internet and hardware to hinder the functionality and useability of a server. This could be used to bring down a website, stop people accessing online stores and crash servers to completely stop all traffic going to and from the desired destination. <br>
          
<br> There are many ways to initiate a Denial of service (DoS) attack. The way DoS works is by flooding the target server with more internet requests as that specific server can handle. <br> 
          
<br>The way to think of it is, the website you are looking to use has a capacity of 1000 people at one time that can view it, if someone was to DoS attack this website (Deny it of serving), they would attempt to flood it with 10 times more than its capacity. The hardware of the server and the internet service provider would not be able to handle that volume of traffic so it would either slow down the website, stop certain services from being able to function or completely crash the website, stopping all services until the DoS attack is stopped.</p>

        <h2>What is a DDoS attack?</h2>
        
        <p>A DDoS or Distributed Denial of Service is a more potent way of bringing down a website or server, it uses the same methods of DoS but in a more aggressive manner and its more difficult to defend against. <br>
          
        <br>It does this more effectively because instead of just one computer attacking another, it uses an array of machines to attack a server all at once. These machines are named "zombie machines" as they have been infected with a virus before the hacker attempting to DDoS a target. The virus sits dormant staying concealed allowing the hacker to use this "zombie machine" when needed. <br>
          
        <br>DDoS is a swarm of machines all attacking one system, overwhelming the target quickly and more effectively, with less chance of being detected because the attacker is remotely using other systems to attack the target. This is more worrying for larger businesses or server clusters because it can cause damage to reputations, loss of money and business and take a lot or resources to overcome the attack.<br>
          
        <br> I will go over some of the ways and terminology used in DoS/DDoS so you will know how these attacks are implemented further down.</p>

        <h2>What are the differences between DoS and DDoS?</h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Traffic Volume</strong> :The amount of traffic a DDoS can deliver compared to DoS is significant due to DDoS using "zombie machines" or "Bots", DoS is only one computer attacking one target, thus the volume of traffic is much smaller and the attacker is easier to track.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Manner Of Exicution</strong> DDoS attacks use something called a command and control (C&C) method to coordinate an attack on a server using these so called "zombie machines" or "Bots", basically a person can use his computer to tell infected devices to do initiate the attack on their server/website. </li>
          
          <li><strong>Tracing Of Source</strong> :Because DDoS makes use of other machines all linked together to create a "botnet" or "zombie swarm" to attack a target, it is much harder to track the source of the attack and defend against it. It is not impossible, but it uses significantly more resources and time than just one machine attempting to DoS a server or website.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Ease of Detection</strong> :The fact that DoS comes from a single computer, you can track it down and terminate the connection. A well configured Firewall can detect this, locate the connection, and terminate and block the connection. This is much harder to do if there are dozens up to hundreds of connections being made with the agenda to cause harm to the server.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Speed of Attack</strong> :The speed of which a DDoS attack can happen from start to full assault is extremely quick and can last from a few hours to a few days. These would be known as a long-term assault. These attacks have the aim of asking for ransom or just knocking the website or server offline for as long as possible for other attacks to the target to take place.</li>
