        <h1>What Damage can be caused!</h1>
        <p>Here, I will explain some of the damage that can be caused by a DoS attack, not just damage to the company through denying use of a website but also physical damage to hardware.</p>

        <h2>Digital Damage</h2>
        <p>The Double D's... Digital Damage refers to damage to the running of a server, network, or application. Slowing it down, stopping it completely or just being a nuisance, usually to cover up the fact that there is another type of attack happening in the background. Smoke Screen DoS and DD0S's are very common in their hacker’s arsenal for breaching cyber defences.<br>
          Compromising a network or server, slowing down websites and shutting down server rooms will have a massive impact on companies that trade, sell and export goods via the internet. As well as companies that store data that need to be accessed regularly by customers will lose the trust of the people who pay for that ability. <br>

        <h2>Physical Damage</h2>
        <p>There are ways to cause physical damage to a company’s hardware by attacking with a Denial-of-Service attack and it doesn’t stop at burning out a server room.<br>
         In 2012 there was a DoS attack on an oil firm, under the name of Saudi Aramco. The hacker group called "cutting Sword of Justice" claimed they were responsible for the attack, after attacking systems in "several counties" with DoS attack and implanting malware, the end attack disabled 30,000 workstations and slowed production and export of the firm’s oil for a few days. The result could have cost millions, but no loss was published by the firm. <br>
        The fact that a DoS or DDoS can be such a hinderance on networks and servers means that when you are trying to fix the issue caused by them you could overlook other attacks, hackers trying force a virus onto the network would be able to do that more easily if you were trying to fix a server meltdown.

        <h2>The 2 Types of overload based DoS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Overload DoS attack at the network layer</strong> :These attacks typically attempt to consume all available capacity on a network links, or to cause a network hardware or software to fail. </li>
          <li><strong>Overload DoS attack at the application layer</strong> :These DoS attacks typically attempt to consume the computers resources of the service by exercising compute-expensive functionality, or by generating many more applications sessions than the service has been designed to cope with.</li><br>
          <p>One is like blocking the pathways into a building and the other is like filling up the building like a chines train, where physically nothing else can get in.</p>
