        <h1>How to Mitigate a DoS or DDoS attack</h1>
        
        <p>Here I will discuss what precautions you can take to mitigate a DoS or DDoS attack. There are no real ways to fully prevent an attack form happening, that’s why it important to have well designed and fully fleshed out mitigation plan and make use of DoS protection companies to assist.</p>

        <h2>Protection Plan</h2>
        
        <p>There are well designed protection plans already available for companies to adopt and expand on. There seems to be a consistent basic check list that companies start off with to start off their protection plan then further develop this plan to adapt to the needs of the company over time.</p>

        <h2>Basic Check List</h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Prepare a DDoS Respons Plan</strong></li>
          <P>The response plan should consist of a clear step by step instructions for all staff to follow and have them trained and practice this regularly enough to know what to in the event of a DDoS attack. This should go from detecting an attack to locking down critical systems up to personal responsibilities and excilation protocols.</P><br>
          
          <li><strong>Improve Network Secuirty</strong></li>
          <p>Network security is the first line of defence as an attacker needs to pile up requests on a network to bring the server or network down. Having a strong firewall to detect DDoS traffic to stop the attack before it gets too much to handle is one thing.</p><br>
      <p>Ant-Virus and anti-malware software ensures that you are not losing control of your system to an attacker before or during a DoS or DDoS attack. These attacks are common for use as a smoke screen to a more malicious attack on your network from a hacker. </p><br>
          
          <li><strong>Ensure Server Redundancy</strong></li>
          
          <p>Server redundancy is a good way to mitigate some damage done by a DDoS attack. If one server gets attacked the other servers won’t be affected and could take some of the traffic that is trying to bottleneck your system. </p><br>
      <p>Having your company use multiple servers hosted at data centres in different regions prevents your system from being successfully blocked or shut down by any one attacker.</p><br>
          
          <li><strong>Look for the Warning Signs</strong></li>
          
          <p>Looking out for the <a href="warnings.html">
<button type="button" class="text-btn">Warning signs</button></a> is crucial to beginning your defence, the sooner you notice your being attacked the easier it will be to stop them doing damage to your network and server.</p><br>
      <p>It’s important to know that not all DoS and DDoS attacks are high-volume, sometimes they are low impact to test the waters. Having all staff trained or have some knowledge of what to look for to help with the defence plan of your company or organisation.</p><br>
          
          <li><strong>Limit Network Broadcasting</strong></li>
          
          <p>The attacker will try to increase the volume if their attack by hitting all the devices on the network. Limiting network broadcasting can counter this tactic by not allowing the hacker to spread the DDoS attack to all the devices from one area of the network to other.</p><br><p>This is good for networks that done need to all communicate directly. It’s also good to instruct personnel to disable echo functions on their devices to stop hacker from spreading that way also.</p><br>
          
          <li><strong>Use Cloud Based Protection</strong></li>
          
          <p> Some of the benefits or using cloud based protection are</p><br><ul>
          <li>Cloud protections providers offer well rounded cyber security with top form firewalls and threat monitoring software.</li>
          <li>The public cloud has a greater bandwidth than any private network.</li>
          <li>Data centres provide high end redundancy with copies of data, system, and equipment.</li>

            <p>Dumping an attacker high-volume DoS attack onto a third party cloud based service that is equipped and trained to handle DDoS attacks is a very good way to mitigate any attack. </p><br>
            
      <p>The choices for using cloud based protection are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-demand cloud DDoS mitigation</strong></li>
        <p>These activate after the in-house team detect a threat. If an attack is detected this service diverts all traffic to cloud resources to keep services online.</p>
        <li><strong>Always-on cloud DDoS Protection</strong></li>
        
        <p>These services route all traffic through a cloud scrubbing centre. This option is best suited for mission-critical apps that cannot afford downtime.</p>
      </ul>

            <h2><strong>Set up Continuous Monitoring</strong></h2>
            
      <p>Continuous monitoring traffic in real time is an excellent method of detecting traces of DDoS activity. The benefits are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Real time monitoring ensures you detect a DDoS attempt before the attack is in full swing.</li>
        <li>The team can establish a strong sense of typical network activity and traffic patterns. Once you know what looks normal, its quicker to identify an attack.</li>
        <li>Around-the-clock monitoring ensures the det4ection of signs of an attack that happens outside of office hours and on weekends.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Monitoring your network traffic is good for all types of defence, even for just regular use and knowing what your company and its staff are connected too.</p>
